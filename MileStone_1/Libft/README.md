The aim of this project is to build a personal C library, designed to solidify foundational knowledge in:
- Core functions
- Dynamic memory management
- Makefiles
- Libraries
- Structs and linked lists

These functions will become valuable tools throughout the course, with the potential to expand by adding more as needed.

A Makefile should define the compilation rules, simplify certain flags, and include the following mandatory targets:
- $(NAME)
- all
- clean
- fclean

The project should avoid unnecessary recompilation, meaning that running make consecutively should only return a message indicating that there’s nothing to be done.

## Recommendations

The recommended time frame for completing this project ranges from one week to two months, with one month being the average. 
Do not try to rush too much, it's best to go at your own pace, develop a `habit`, and `learn`.
If you get stuck on a function, it's advisable to `move on to the next one` and come back later. 
Doing the bonus is highly recommended, as you will need and use it later.
